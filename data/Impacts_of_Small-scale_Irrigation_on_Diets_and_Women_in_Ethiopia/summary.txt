Small-scale irrigation is increasingly recognized as a pivotal strategy for improving agricultural
productivity and food security in sub-Saharan Africa, especially amidst growing climate
variability and changes. Over the past decades, small-scale irrigation has expanded rapidly in
sub-Saharan Africa, providing smallholder farmers with an opportunity to improve their
livelihoods, diets and resilience to climate change. While existing evidence highlights its wide-
ranging benefits, including improved food security, crop diversification, and employment
opportunities, less attention has been devoted to understanding its effects on nutritious diets,
women's empowerment, and gender equality. This study seeks to fill this gap by rigorously
examining the causal impacts of small-scale irrigation on these critical dimensions, utilizing
data from the "Megetch Pump Irrigation and Drainage Project (MPIDP)" in Ethiopia's Amhara
Regional State. Employing a plot-level Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design
and survey data, we estimate the causal impact of access to irrigation on womenâ€™s
empowerment and nutrition diets, leveraging the unique topographical setup of the irrigation
command area and canal construction. Our finding suggests that access to irrigation does not
exhibit a significant impact on overall empowerment levels for both women and men. Gender
parity among the beneficiaries remains largely unchanged. It is worth noting that empowerment
levels were already relatively high in the study area, across various pro-WEAI indicators.
Despite the overall impact, access to irrigation enhances women's likelihood of achieving
empowerment in terms of decision-making power in productive activities and access to
financial services. This instrumental agency measure suggests a positive step towards
economic empowerment. However, there is a noteworthy decrease in some individual
empowerment indicators, particularly in terms of respect among household members and self-
efficacy. Even with observing a significant increase in dry-season crop production attributed to
irrigation, there is no substantial evidence of improvement in nutritional outcomes. This result
may be influenced by the government's focus on increasing wheat production, directing
irrigated land towards this crop.
