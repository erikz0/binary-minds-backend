Poor and non-existent infrastructure is widespread in Nigeria, which constrains market functionality
and market access of rural farmers, mostly women, and worsens poverty and nutrition levels. Road
infrastructure deficit is more pronounced in the rural areas where the bulk of agricultural activities reside
alongside higher levels of malnutrition and poverty. More concerning still, women are responsible for a
large percentage of total food production, yet face many constraints at every point in the food system
which affects their productivity and ability to access markets. This is likely to disempower rural women
and further worsen gender inequality concerns in Nigeria.
In response to the problems of inadequate road infrastructure in rural areas, several development
projects have focused on rural road provision, however, empirical studies linking road infrastructure
to household nutrition, women empowerment and gender inequality are limited in Nigeria. This study
therefore attempts to measure the impact of the rural road infrastructure component of the Value Chain
Development Programme (VCDP) on household nutrition, women empowerment and gender equality.
The VCDP was initiated by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in partnership with
the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to address the constraints along the commodity value chains
of rice and cassava.
